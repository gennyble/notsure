# notsure
I'm not sure what this is. I'm feeling kind of burnt today and I have some RSI in on of my wrist, so instead of reading a book in my too-read book-pile I have decided to play with OpenGL. A good idea, obviously. Anyway, not sure what this is or how many typos are in this readme; my spellcheck is broken and I'm tired.
